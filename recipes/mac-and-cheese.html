        <p>"This is definitely a favorite in my house," says Magic. "I use almond milk instead of regular milk and add chicken to make it a macaroni chicken casserole. Also added more Cheddar."
        </p>

        <p>"This recipe is unmistakably baked and homemade," according to one Allrecipes community member. "Anyone who says they don't like macaroni and cheese has never tried this recipe."
        </p>

        <p>"So delicious," raves Amy Lemelin. "I added a teaspoon of crushed garlic and a dash of chili pepper. I typed with crushed saltines and cooked bacon. This is my new favorite recipe!"

        <h2 class="headings">Directions</h2>

        <p><span class="bold">Step 1</span><br>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Step 2</span><br>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Step 3</span><br>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Step 4</span><br>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Step 5</span><br>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Step 6</span><br>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</p>
